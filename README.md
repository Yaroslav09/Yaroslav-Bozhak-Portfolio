# React Portfolio

## Description

This project aims to create the initial scaffolding for a portfolio site using React. The motivation behind building this project is to showcase my skills and projects to potential employers in a professional and modern way. It solves the problem of having a static portfolio by providing a dynamic and interactive platform to display projects, skills, and contact information. Throughout this project, I learned how to structure a React application, utilize React Router for navigation.
